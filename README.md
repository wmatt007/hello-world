Copied code for Adafruit Storm Cloud project
Our goal with this project is to replace a simple household ceiling light with an awesome cloud lamp that contains 150 dynamically
controlled LEDs.  There are a few important features this needs in order to be better than the same-old lame-old lamps found in
your neighborhood IKEA.

Bluetooth enabled - Don’t you hate getting out of bed right before you go to sleep just to turn out a light somewhere?  Since we
all pretty much sleep with our phones within arm’s reach, let’s make the cloud controllable via bluetooth.
Multiple lighting modes - To say that lights should “just light the room up” would reinforce an age-old concession that their sole
purpose is to be unbearably boring.  Our cloud should have different color modes and patterns for days... or rather for nights.
Brightness control - Most bulbs have only two brightness levels: on or off.  But what if you want a bright light for when you’re
working and a soft ambient light for when you’re relaxing?  This is a must for the cloud.
